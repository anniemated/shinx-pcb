you can rub its belly or let the photoresistor light up its ears -- it glows in the dark! if you touch its tail, it'll zap you (activates a motor). it also has a lot of clicky buttons so it can double as a fidget toy as well :D

## bom
- 1 battery holder
- 2 5mm leds
- 1 resistor
- 1 mini dc motor
- 5 6mm push buttons
